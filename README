* This program was written and tested using .net core 2.0, and has been tested on both Mac and Windows

* There are 3 separate projects in the solution:
 1) PositionCalculator - this is a classlib project, containing the core logic of the PositionCalculator program
 2) PositionCalculator.Tests - xunit test project for unit testing the PositionCalulator 
 3) PositionCalculator.ClientApp - a console application acting as the client app that accepts the fully qualified path to a valid csv input file containing the positions.  The input file is expected to have a header line.  The program will then output the net positions and boxed positions to the console in the expected format.

* Instructions:
 * To run xunit test:
  * From the root directory, execute the below commands:
  * cd PositionCalculator.Tests
  * dotnet test
 * To run the console application:
  * From the root directory, execute the below command:
  * dotnet run --project PositionCalculator.ClientApp <full_path_to_input_file>
